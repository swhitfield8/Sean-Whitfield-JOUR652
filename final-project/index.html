        <h1>Maryland enshrines abortion rights in its constitution</h1>

      <p id="byline">BY MARISSA YELENIK</p>
      <p>Question 1 in, Maryland's approval balot, simplyfies an important victory for reproductive rights, particularly as a safeguard in the wake of national shifts like the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In the statement of Question 1, it says, "The fundamental right to reproductive freedom, including but not limited to the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end one's own pregnancy." The decision not only codifies the right to abortion, but also to stregthen the foundation for reproductive freedoms in Maryland by evaluating them to the level of constitutional protection. 
      <p>This shift is particularly meaningful given the fear that national political shifts could endanger the accessibility of abortion and reproductive healthcare. Cities, like some conservatives, worry that the amendment is too broad and has the potential to go beyond abortion.</p>
      <p>The fear is allowing minors to access abortion without the consent of parental guidence or gender-affirming procedures included. They are also worried about the exposion of vulnurable minors that are invlolved in sex trafficing. Though current state law requires parental notification for minors seeking abortion, critics worried the amendment could be interpreted to bypass parental involvement. The debate over this referendum shoows the difficulty in balancing personal freedom with conerns about possible misuse. As other states consider similar measures, this issue will stay central in national debates, with strong opinions on both sides about what fair reproductive healthcare should look like.</p>

      <p>Being denied a wanted abortion takes away a person's control over their body and future decisions. 95% of people who have an abortion feel they made the right choice five years later. For those who are denied an abortion, it can lead to negative effects on their health, finances, and overall well-being. Having full access to abortion clinics is essential for health, quality, and well-being. Safe, legal abortions reduce the risks of unsafe procedures, which can cause serious harm or death. <p>
      Without regulated clinics, women may be forced into dangerous situations that put their health at risk. It also helps to reduce social and economic inequalities. Restrictions disproportionately impact low-income women and women of color, who may not have the resources to travel or afford the procedure. Denying access can trap women in pverty, limiting their opportunities and ability to fully participate in society.</p>

      <p>Forcing someone to carry an unwanted pregnancy can cause emotional distress and long-term psychological harm. Being able to make decisions about reproductive health helps protect mental well-being and gives individuals control over their lives.</p>

        <p><span id="blockquote"></span>The decision to have an abortion is a deeply personal decision between a woman, her family, her doctor, her God; not her government, and not the public at large."</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>Abortion rights in America are a controversial issue, shaped by politics, culture, and public health concerns. The main question is whether individuals, especially women, should have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, or if the government should impose restrictions. Supporters of abortion rights argue that access to safe and legal abortion is important for gender equality, economic opportunities, and personal freedom. They also point out that restrictions on abortion often hurt low-income people and communities of color, who may not have the means to travel to states with fewer limits or find the care they need. </p>
